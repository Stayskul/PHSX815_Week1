# PHSX815_Week1
repository for week 1 assignments in PHSX 815
This document contains instructions for running all of the codes for week 1

For the HW 1 assignment (randomnumbertofile.py)
  Firstly, the reference material for the code came from two places:
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67360213/python-write-and-read-random-numbers-to-file

  https://github.com/crogan/PHSX815_Week1/blob/main/python/Random_python.py

  Upon running the code "randomnumbertofile.py", it will ask how many random numbers you want generated,
  simply input the number. For my testing I was inputting 1000. Then it should give you a histogram of these numbers.
